Lamark
======

A Java based library for executing genetic algorithms


Notes and Caveats
-----------------
Lamark is a library I wrote back in 2006 when I was contemplating doing my masters thesis on music generated via genetic
algorithm.  Fast-forward to 2014 - I've long ago finished my masters thesis ([on a different topic, as it turns out]
(http://books.google.com/books/about/An_Improved_Algorithm_for_Deinterlacing.html?id=W41unQEACAAJ), buy your
copy today!) and was looking for some library I've written that's reasonably complete and I wouldn't be ashamed of, such
that I can practice doing releases into the public Maven repository... and this is the one I chose.

As Java-based GA processors go, Lamark isn't too bad - it supports generics, plugs in pretty easily with Spring, and
even has some attachments for running the browser as a plugin or distributing via a custom HTTP protocol.  Having said
that, if you are actually doing research, you may wanna look at these competitors too:
* [Watchmaker](http://watchmaker.uncommons.org/)
* [Jenes](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jenes/)
* [Jenetics](http://jenetics.sourceforge.net/)
* [Java-GaLib](http://sourceforge.net/projects/java-galib/)
* [ECJ](http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/)
* [Apache Math/Genetic Algos](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/userguide/genetics.html)

The main thing I'm trying to accomplish, though, is allow you to add Lamark to your project by using Maven - so
you'll know I've hit my goal when you see the Maven import listed below:

> Nope!
> It is simply
> Not here yet
> But I'm working on it!

Best,
